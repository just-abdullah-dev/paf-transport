# PAF-IAST Transportation System

The **PAF-IAST Transportation System** is a web-based application built to manage and automate student transportation within a university. This system allows the university administration to efficiently manage student registrations, bus route assignments, fee tracking, and the generation of unique QR codes for fee validation, all within a single platform.

The project is developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and ease of customization. The system offers both backend and frontend functionalities, making it a scalable solution for future growth.

### Features

- **Route Management (CRUD)**: Add, update, delete, and view bus routes and buses assigned to them.
- **Student Registration & Management (CRUD)**: Register students, update their data, and manage their assigned routes.
- **Fee Tracking**: Track student fee payments, mark them as paid/unpaid, and generate reports on the fee status.
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate unique QR codes linked to each studentâ€™s fee status for quick validation at bus boarding.
- **User Role Management**: Different roles (Admin, Bus Staff, Bank Staff) with varying access to features based on their permissions.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
